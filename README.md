# Loan-Defaulters-Logistic-Regression-Decision-Tree
## Objective :
The aim of the project is to determine whether a loan will default or not using different variables.

## Dataset :
The dataset is obtained from kaggle.
- https://www.kaggle.com/c/loan-default-prediction/data

## Methodology :
The number of loan defaulters is lesser than the number of loanees with no loan default.Inorder to make the sample values proportionate undersampling was done.
Commonly used classification models like Decision Tree and Logistic Regression were used.

## Result :
* Decision Tree Accuracy : 0.84
* Logistic Regression Accuracy : 0.50
- Thus, decision tree was taken into consideration.
